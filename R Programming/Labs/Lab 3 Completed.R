# Exercise 2: indexing and filtering vectors

# Create a vector `first_ten` that has the values 10 through 20 in it (using 
# the : operator)
first_ten = c(10:20)

# Create a vector `next_ten` that has the values 21 through 30 in it (using the 
# seq() function)
next_ten = c(seq(21,30))

# Create a vector `all_numbers` by combining the previous two vectors
all_numbers = c(first_ten, next_ten)

# Create a variable `eleventh` that contains the 11th element in `all_numbers`
eleventh = all_numbers[11]

# Create a vector `some_numbers` that contains the 2nd through the 5th elements 
# of `all_numbers`
some_numbers = all_numbers[2:5]


# Create a vector `even` that holds the even numbers from 1 to 100
even = c(seq(2,100, by = 2))

# Using the `all()` function and `%%` (modulo) operator, confirm that all of the
# numbers in your `even` vector are even
all(even %% 2 == 0)


# Create a vector `phone_numbers` that contains the numbers 8, 6, 7, 5, 3, 0, 9
phone_number = c(8,6,7,5,3,0,9)

# Create a vector `prefix` that has the first three elements of `phone_numbers`
prefix = phone_number[1:3]

# Create a vector `small` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
# less than or equal to 5
small = phone_number[phone_number <= 5]

# Create a vector `large` that has the values of `phone_numbers` that are 
# strictly greater than 5
large = phone_number[phone_number > 5]

# Replace the values in `phone_numbers` that are larger than 5 with the number 5
phone_number = replace(phone_number, phone_number > 5, 5)

# Replace every odd-numbered value in `phone_numbers` with the number 0
phone_number = replace(phone_number, phone_number %% 2 != 0, 0)
